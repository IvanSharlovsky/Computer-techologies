# LabWorks 3-4

## Processes in the UNIX operating system

- ### 1. Write a program that prints the PID and PPID values ​​for the current process. Run it several times in a row. Observe how the current process ID changes. Explain the observed changes

- ### 2. Compile program 03-1c (an example of creating a new process with the same work of the child and parent processes) and run it. Analyze the result

- ### 3. Modify the previous program (03-1.c) with fork() so that the parent and child perform different actions (it does not matter which)

- ### 4. Write a program that prints the values ​​of the command line arguments and environmental parameters for the current process

- ### 5. Compile program 03-2.c (using the exec() system call) and run it. Since during normal operation the contents of a file named 03-2.c will be printed, such a file must be present in the current directory when launched. Analyze the result

- ### 6. Modify the program (03-1.c) (see point 3) so that the spawned process launches a new (any) program for execution

- ### 7. Modify the program 03-1.c (use the switch operator)
